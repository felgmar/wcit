# wcit â€“ Windows CLI Installer Tool  

## ðŸ“Œ What is this?  
**Windows CLI Installer Tool** is a C# program that deploys Windows onto any storage device **from within an existing Windows installation**, eliminating the need to reboot into a separate installer.  

By running multiple instances, you can install Windows on several devices at once â€” as many as you have instances running. This can be useful for:  
- Rapid OS deployment in IT environments  
- Preparing multiple drives for testing or distribution  
- Automating repetitive installation tasks
